Get to know industry standard patterns as well as situational patterns. Decouple your application with these set of “Idea patterns”. Key FeaturesMobile development in React Native should be done in a reusable way. Learn how to build scalable applications using JavaScript patterns that are battle tested.Try effective techniques on your own using over 80 standalone examples.Book Description React Native helps developers reuse code across different mobile platforms like iOS and Android. This book will show you effective design patterns in the React Native world and will make you ready for professional development in big teams. The book will focus only on the patterns that are relevant to JavaScript, ECMAScript, React and React Native. However, you can successfully transfer a lot of the skills and techniques to other languages. I call them “Idea patterns”. This book will start with the most standard development patterns in React like component building patterns, styling patterns in React Native and then extend these patterns to your mobile application using real world practical examples. Each chapter comes with full, separate source code of applications that you can build and run on your phone. The book is also diving into architectural patterns. Especially how to adapt MVC to React environment. You will learn Flux architecture and how Redux is implementing it. Each approach will be presented with its pros and cons. You will learn how to work with external data sources using libraries like Redux thunk and Redux Saga. The end goal is the ability to recognize the best solution for a given problem for your next mobile application. What you will learnExplore the design Patterns in React NativeLearn the best practices for React Native developmentExplore common React patterns that are highly used within React Native developmentLearn to decouple components and use dependency injection in your applicationsExplore the best ways of fetching data from the backend systemsLearn the styling patterns and how to implement custom mobile designsExplore the best ways to organize your application code in big codebasesWho this book is for The ideal target audience for this book are people eager to learn React Native design patterns who already know the basics of JavaScript. We can assume that the target audience already knows how to write Hello World in JavaScript and know what are the functions, recursive functions, JavaScript types and loops.",

This workshop will help you learn how and show you how to develop and enhance web apps using the features of the React framework with interesting examples and exercises. The workshop starts by demonstrating how to create your first React project. You’ll tap into React’s popular feature JSX to develop templates and use DOM events to make your project interactive. Next, you’ll focus on the lifecycle of the React component and understand how components are created, mounted, unmounted, and destroyed. Later, you’ll create and customize components to understand the data flow in React and how props and state communicate between components. You’ll also use Formik to create forms in React to explore the concept of controlled and uncontrolled components and even play with React Router to navigate between React components. The chapters that follow will help you build an interesting image-search app to fetch data from the outside world and populate the data to the React app. Finally, you’ll understand what ref API is and how it is used to manipulate DOM in an imperative way. By the end of this React book, you’ll have the skills you need to set up and create web apps using React. What you will learnUse JSX to include logic in the view layer of applicationsGet familiar with the important methods and events in the React lifecycleDistinguish between class and functional component syntaxesCreate forms with Formik and handle errorsUnderstand the React Hooks API and the problems it can solveFetch outside data using the Axios library and populate the data to the appWho this book is for The React Workshop is for web developers and programmers who are looking to learn React and use it for creating and enhancing web applications. Although the workshop is for beginners, prior knowledge of JavaScript programming and HTML and CSS is necessary to easily understand the concepts that are covered.",

Harry Potter has never even heard of Hogwarts when the letters start dropping on the doormat at number four, Privet Drive. Addressed in green ink on yellowish parchment with a purple seal, they are swiftly confiscated by his grisly aunt and uncle. Then, on Harry's eleventh birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with some astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. An incredible adventure is about to begin! Having become classics of our time, the Harry Potter eBooks never fail to bring comfort and escapism. With their message of hope, belonging and the enduring power of truth and love, the story of the Boy Who Lived continues to delight generations of new readers.",

The twists and turns of the series, as well as the psychological depth and complexity of J. K. Rowling’s characters, have kept fans enthralled with and puzzling over the many mysteries that permeate Hogwarts and beyond: • Do the Harry Potter books encourage disobedience? • Why is everyone so fascinated by Professor Lupin? • What exactly will Harry and his friends do when they finally pass those N.E.W.T.s? • Do even wizards live by the ticking of the clock? • Is Harry destined to end up alone? And why did it take Ron and Hermione so long to get together? Now, in The Psychology of Harry Potter, leading psychologists delve into the ultimate Chamber of Secrets, analyzing human mind and motivation by examining the themes and characters that make the Harry Potter books the bestselling fantasy series of all time. Grab a spot on the nearest couch, and settle in for some fresh revelations about our favorite young wizard!",

          "description": "New York Times bestselling author Pam Anderson updates her classic cookbook—which put \"cooking by heart\" on the map—to include modern flavors and new techniques that today's home cooks will love, with new and original full-color photographs. It's been 17 years since the blockbuster How to Cook Without a Book was published, and Pam Anderson's method of mastering easy techniques to create simple, delicious meals is even more relevant today. From the working professional who loves cooking to the busy family member trying to get dinner on the table, today's modern home cook wants to master useful techniques and know how to stock pantries and refrigerators to pull together delicious meals on the fly. Understanding that most recipes are simply \"variations on a theme,\" Pam innovatively teaches technique, ultimately eliminating the need for recipes. The new edition will reflect ingredients and techniques home cooks love to use today: chicken dishes are revamped by using thighs instead of boneless skinless breasts; hearty, dark greens like kale and swiss chard replace hearts of Romaine in salads; roasted Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes move from side dish to the main event in more meatless entrees; plus, tips for creating a whole meal using one pot or one sheet pan (instead of dirtying multiple dishes). Each chapter contains helpful at-a-glance charts that highlight the key points of every technique and a master recipe with enough variations to keep you going until you've learned how to cook without a book.",

          "description": "The most favored Dutch cookbook of the seventeenth century, The Sensible Cook (De Verstandige Kock) had a major impact on the foodways of the Dutch in the Netherlands and in their New World territories. As a part of the larger work, The Pleasurable Country Life, The Sensible Cook records the foodways of rich middle-class households, the cooking methods and typical dishes they prepared, and the implements and ingredients they employed. Often the recipes are surprisingly sophisticated. From braising a chicken with orange peel and cinnamon to stuffing pigeons with a mixture of parsley, ginger, sugar, butter, and raisins, many of the dishes are still appealing today. Peter G. Rose has, in fact, adapted some two dozen of the recipes for contemporary use—tempting dishes such as “Shoemaker’s Cake,” a delicious combination of bread crumbs, butter, eggs, and stewed apples. Handsomely illustrated with Dutch genre paintings, The Sensible Cook will interest cooks, food historians, students of social and cultural history, and the large number of Dutch descendants in America. Most important, this book will be welcomed by all who enjoy good food.",

          "description": "Published in 1872 in Boston, The Appledore Cook Book was authored by renowned cooking teacher and writer Maria Parloa to be a go-to cookbook for new brides and housekeepers, and it was specifically geared toward simpler recipes with less expensive ingredients. This first of many cookbooks by Parloa was inspired by her time spent cooking at the Appledore House hotel on the Isles of Shoals, Maine. The Appledore Cook Book contains the first known recipe for tomato chowder (known today as tomato soup) as well as delectable family-sized recipes such as Lamb Chops, Dumplings for Soup, Baked Potatoes, Fried Ham, Buckwheat Cakes, Apple Cake, Ginger Snaps, and Pumpkin Pie. Emphasizing the purpose of this popular cookbook, Parloa states in the preface, “The great trouble with all the cook books which I have known . . . is, that they are too expensive, and that they use weight instead of measure, and also that they take for granted that the young housekeeper knows many things which she really does not.” With The Appledore Cook Book, Parloa provides just such a cookbook of simple-yet-tasty, inexpensive meals—a theme as popular in the 19th century as it is today. This edition of The Appledore Cook Book was reproduced by permission from the volume in the collection of the American Antiquarian Society, Worcester, Massachusetts. Founded in 1812 by Isaiah Thomas, a Revolutionary War patriot and successful printer and publisher, the society is a research library documenting the lives of Americans from the colonial era through 1876. The society collects, preserves, and makes available as complete a record as possible of the printed materials from the early American experience. The cookbook collection comprises approximately 1,100 volumes.",

          "description": "From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Deceptively Delicious, an essential collection of more than 100 simple recipes that will transform even the most kitchen-phobic “Can’t Cooks” into “Can Cooks.” Are you smart enough to dodge a telemarketer yet clueless as to how to chop a clove of garlic? Are you clever enough to forward an e-mail but don’t know the difference between broiling and baking? Ingenious enough to operate a blow-dryer but not sure how to use your blender? If you are basically competent, then Jessica Seinfeld’s The Can’t Cook Book is for you. If you find cooking scary or stressful or just boring, Jessica has a calm, confidencebuilding approach to cooking, even for those who’ve never followed a recipe or used an oven. Jessica shows you how to prepare deliciously simple food—from Caesar salad, rice pilaf, and roasted asparagus to lemon salmon, roast chicken, and flourless fudge cake. At the beginning of each dish, she explains up front what the challenge will be, and then shows you exactly how to overcome any hurdles in easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions. Designed to put the nervous cook at ease, The Can’t Cook Book is perfect for anyone who wants to gain confidence in the kitchen—and, who knows, maybe even master a meal or two.",
